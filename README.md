## Problems :
Currently, Archive.org is a widely used platform we all have used for different purposes but there are limitations due to its centralized structure so if there is a decentralized and censorship-proof archive platform then it can add lot many benifits. 

**1. Centralized data storage:** There is always a chance of a central point of failure no matter entity is nonprofit organization or a company.

**2. No way to incentivize contributors:** From books and newspapers banned due to conspiracy issues to documentaries, contributors are publishing everything to help community but there is no incentive mechanism for them.

**3. Censorship issues:**  From centralized database and control, content can be taken down.

## Solution 

Untouched Archive - is a decentralized and censorship proof solution to archive.org for the community to store Books, Newspapers, Documentaries, and historical Web pages on persistent storage powered by Filecoin - IPFS.
